You can either edit files or add entirely new ones here.

ABOUT EDITTING:
It doesn't matter if you want to edit something in assets/shared/images/ or assets/preload/images/,
you will have to put the editted files in mods/images/, it will be handled automatically by the engine.
Also, if you edit any of the regular assets and move it to the mods folder, it will override the vanilla assets.
